Since our inception in Tokyo, Japan, during the early 2000s, we have been dedicated to bringing the rich tradition of ramen to the world. Our journey brought us to Vancouver in 2014, where we have continued to craft our dishes with the utmost care and respect for the traditional methods of ramen cooking.\n\nAs we approach a significant milestone in our Vancouver chapter, we are preparing to celebrate our 10th anniversary with a special event that we have dubbed the \"Open House.\" This exclusive gathering will take place on June 18, 2024, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM at our Vancouver location.\n\nThe \"Open House\" event is designed to immerse attendees in the world of ramen, offering insights into the history and preparation of this beloved Japanese dish. Highlights of the event include:\n\n- An introduction to the basics of ramen, including its varieties and significance in Japanese cuisine.\n\n- A live demonstration of our traditional ramen cooking process, starting with the preparation of our signature broth.\n\n- Hands-on participation in making various ramen ingredients, providing a unique understanding of the craftsmanship involved.\n\n- An opportunity for all attendees to prepare their own ramen under the guidance of our experienced chefs.\n\nYour presence at this event is of great importance to us. We believe that your attendance will not only add prestige to the occasion but also help us in our mission to spread the appreciation of authentic ramen.\n\nTo confirm your attendance, please RSVP by June 9, 2024, via email at menya.enterprises@gmail.com. Our team will be in touch to assist you with any arrangements or inquiries you may have.\n\nWe eagerly await the opportunity to welcome you to Yah-Yah-Ya Ramen and share with you the passion and dedication that have driven us over the past decade.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nYah-Yah-Ya Ramen\nmenya.enterprises@gmail.com"
